This notebook is a small Python tool designed to analyse client scenarios and payoffs for equity structured products, mainly autocall / Phoenix structures.
It focuses on understanding how coupons, early redemption and client returns evolve under different market conditions (spot and volatility shocks).

The goal is to provide intuitive metrics and visuals that can be used in a client or sales context, rather than a full pricing model.
